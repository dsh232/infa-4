The leaves in the field turned yellow,
And they spin and fly;
Only in the forest the drooping spruce
trees keep the gloomy greens.
Under an overhanging rock
He really doesn't like it, between the flowers,
The ploughman takes a rest sometimes
From the midday labors.
A beast, brave, involuntarily
He's in a hurry to hide somewhere.
The moon is dim at night, and the field
Through the fog, only silver.
